# Description #

This is just a shell script to retrieve EGA file IDs for the data set concerned.

EGA dataset IDs have been preset in the script; therefore, you have to modify it if you want to retrieve file IDs of data set other than CLUC data.

This script shell is only for the staff relevant to CLUC data in TraIT.
